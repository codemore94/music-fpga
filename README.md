# FPGA-Driven DSP Filtering and Visualization for Audio, Team Enlightened, EC551, Boston University

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of audio processing for the management of program states and visualization. By connecting and integrating multiple types of peripherals onto an FPGA board, applications that could benefit from low latency, such as audio processing, dynamic lighting, and responsiveness to environment, can be fully showcased. The potential for use along with current home automation systems, where multiple tasks need to be carried out simultaneously and quickly, is well demonstrated in this way.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
